### About Me

I'm a computer scientist and a software engineer.

Although the main tool used in this area is a computer, I thrive on human contact and the most important part of a project is the team I progress with.
The next checkbox when I look for a job is meaningfulness, so my perfect position is one where my colleagues are as friendly as competent and where we are motivated to help people, at our scale.

### About Me

I'm a computer scientist and a software engineer.

Although the main tool used in this area is a computer, I thrive on human contact and the most important part of a project for me is the team.
The next checkbox when I look for a job is its meaningfulness, so my ideal position is one where my colleagues are as friendly as competent and where we are trying to help people, at our scale.

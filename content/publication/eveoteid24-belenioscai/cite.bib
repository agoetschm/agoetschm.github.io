abstract="In this work we consider Belenios-CaI, a protocol offering a cast-as-intended mechanism and building upon Belenios, a voting system used in about 7000 elections to date. We modify the design of Belenios-Cai from the user perspective without changing its core cryptographic mechanism. The goal is to increase its usability by letting the voter simply check whether two symbols are equal or different.",
